Anyway.I have the documents.About the
 new Berlin offices.
We're going to be open in three months.Anna
 moved here from London just last week.
They are very nice offices, and the location is perfect.There are lots of restaurants, cafés and banks in the area.
There's also public transport; we are next to an U-Bahn (that is the name for the metro here).
Maybe you can come.And see them one day?I would love to show you Berlin.Especially in the winter.
You said you have a radar never seen snow – you will see lots here!
